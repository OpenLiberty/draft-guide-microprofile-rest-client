= Adding health reports to microservices

Explore how to report and check the health of a microservice with MicroProfile Health.

// =================================================================================================
//  What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use MicroProfile Health to report the health status of microservices and take
appropriate actions based on this report.

MicroProfile Health allows services to report their health, and it publishes the overall health status to a defined
endpoint. A service reports `UP` if it is available and reports `DOWN` if it is unavailable. MicroProfile Health reports
an individual service status at the endpoint and indicates the overall status as `UP` if all the services are `UP`. A service
orchestrator can then use the health statuses to make decisions.

A service checks its own health by performing necessary self-checks and then reports its overall status by
implementing the API provided by MicroProfile Health. A self-check can be a check on anything that the service needs, such
as a dependency, a successful connection to an endpoint, a system property, a database connection, or
the availability of required resources.

You will add self-checks to the `system` and `inventory` services, which have been provided for you, and implement what is
necessary to report health status by using MicroProfile Health.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root directory of this guide contains two services that are configured
to use MicroProfile Health. Feel free to give them a try before you proceed.

To try out the services, navigate to the `finish` directory and then run the Maven `install` and
`liberty:start-server` goals to build the services and run them in Open Liberty:

```
cd finish
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

The `system` and `inventory` services can be found at the following URLs:

- http://localhost:9080/system/properties

- http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems

Visit the `http://localhost:9080/health` URL to see the health report of the two services as well as the overall
health status of the application:

```
{
  "checks": [
      {
        "data": {},
        "name": "System",
        "state": "UP"
      },
      {
        "data": {},
        "name": "Inventory",
        "state": "UP"
      }
  ],
  "outcome": "UP"
}
```

The two checks represent the state of `system` and `inventory` services respectively.
As you might expect, both services are in the `UP` state, and the overall health status of
the application is `UP`. In each check, the data property is left empty because it is optional.
This property is used to add custom information that the serviceâ€™s health check can consume.

When you are done checking out the services, stop the Open Liberty server by running the following command:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

== Adding health checks to microservices

A health report will be generated automatically for all services that enable MicroProfile Health. This
feature has already been enabled for you in the `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file:

[source, xml, role="no_copy"]
----
<feature>mpHealth-1.0</feature>
----

All services must provide an implementation of the `HealthCheck` interface, which will be used to
verify their health.


// =================================================================================================
// Adding a health check to the system service
// =================================================================================================

=== Adding a health check to the system service

Before you proceed, navigate to the `start` directory where you will find the starting project:

```
cd ../start
```

Implement the `HealthCheck` interface in the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemHealth.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemHealth.java[tags=SystemHealth]
----

The `@Health` annotation indicates that this particular bean implements the `HealthCheck` interface.
By pairing this annotation with the `ApplicationScoped` context from the Contexts and Dependency Injections API, the bean is discovered
automatically when the `http://localhost:9080/health` endpoint receives a request.

The `call()` method is used to return the health status of a particular service. In this case, you are simply
checking if the server name is `defaultServer` and returning `UP` if it is, and `DOWN` otherwise.
The `HealthCheckResponse.named()` method is used to indicate what service the health check is done for.
Overall, this is a very simple implementation of the `call()` method. In a real development environment,
you would want to orchestrate much more meaningful health checks.


// =================================================================================================
// Adding a health check to the inventory service
// =================================================================================================

=== Adding a health check to the inventory service

Implement the `HealthCheck` interface in the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryHealth.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryHealth.java[tags=InventoryHealth]
----

This time, you are checking if the service is in maintenance or available. For simplicity,
a custom `io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance` MicroProfile Config property defined in the
`resources/CustomConfigSource.json` file is used to indicate whether the service is down or not. This file
has already been created for you. To check if the service is down, simply make a HTTP GET request to the `system` service
and check the status returned by the response. You make a GET request to the `system` service rather than the `inventory`
service because the `inventory` service depends on the `system` service. In other words, the `inventory`
service wouldn't work if the `system` service is down. If the status is not `200`, then the service is not running.
Based on these two factors, the `isHealthy()` method returns whether or not the `inventory` service is healthy.

If you are curious about the injected `inventoryConfig` object or if you want more information on
MicroProfile Config, see https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config.html[Configuring microservices].

// =================================================================================================
// Building and running the application
// =================================================================================================

include::{common-includes}/mvnbuild.adoc[]

While the server is running, navigate to the `http://localhost:9080/health` URL to find the the health
report on the two services.

Put the `inventory` service in maintenance by setting the `io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance`
property to `true` in the `resources/CustomConfigSource.json` file. Because this configuration file
is picked up dynamically, simply refresh the `http://localhost:9080/health` URL you will see that the
state of the `inventory` service has changed to `DOWN`. The overall state of the application has also
changed to `DOWN` as a result. Point to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` URL to verify
that the `inventory` service is indeed in maintenance. Set the `io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance`
property back to `false` once you are done.


// =================================================================================================
// Testing health checks
// =================================================================================================

== Testing health checks

You will implement two test methods, `testIfServicesAreUp()` and `testIfInventoryServiceIsDown()`, to
validate the health of the `system` and `inventory` services.

Begin by creating a test class in the `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java[tags=HealthTest]
----

Let's break down the test cases:

- The `testIfServicesAreUp()` test case compares the generated health report with the actual status
of the services.
- The `testIfInventoryServiceIsDown()` test cases puts the `inventory` service in maintenance by
setting the `io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance` property to `true` and then compares
the generated health report with the actual status of the service.

A few more tests have been included to verify the basic functionalitiy of the `system` and `inventory`
services. They can be found under the `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryEndpointTest.java`
and `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemEndpointTest.java` files. If a test failure occurs, then you might
have introduced a bug into the code. These tests will run automatically as a part of the Maven build
process when you run the `mvn install` command. You can also run these tests separately from the build
by using the `mvn verify` command, but first make sure that the server is stopped.

== Great work! You're done!

You just learned how to add health checks to report the states of microservices by using MicroProfile Config.
Then, you wrote tests to validate the generated health report.

Feel free to try one of the related MicroProfile guides. They demonstrate additional technologies that you
can learn and expand on top of what you built here.
